# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# If youâ€™re hosting your documentation on ReadTheDocs, you should consider
# adding an explicit placement for their ethical advertisements. These are
# non-tracking advertisements from ethical companies, and they help
# ReadTheDocs sustain themselves and their free service.
#
# Ethical advertisements are added to your sidebar by default. To ensure
# they are there if you manually update your sidebar, ensure that the
# sidebar-ethical-ads.html template is added to your list. For example:

html_sidebars = {
    "**": ["search-field.html", "sidebar-nav-bs.html", "sidebar-ethical-ads.html"]
}
